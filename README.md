Project Overview
Our solution for the SMUBIA Datathon 2025 leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to transform unstructured text data into structured, actionable intelligence. Using the Python library **spaCy**, our tool extracts key entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) and identifies complex relationships between them. This capability is particularly valuable for internal security departments (ISD), enabling them to process and analyze sensitive documents with precision and speed.  

The tool also integrates Streamlit for an interactive web-based interface, allowing users to upload documents, view real-time analyses, and download results. Key relationships and entities are visualized using NetworkX and **matplotlib**, providing intuitive insights into complex data.

Key Features
1. Entity Extraction: Identifies and categorizes entities such as people, organizations, and locations using spaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER).  
2. Relationship Extraction: Detects and classifies relationships between entities using custom patterns and dependency parsing.  
3. Risk Analysis:** Analyzes extracted data to identify potential risks using a keyword-based risk scoring matrix.  
4. Data Visualization:**  
   - Network Graphs:** Visualizes relationships between entities using NetworkX.  
   - Bar Charts:** Displays risk distribution and other key metrics using matplotlib.  
5. Interactive Dashboard:** Built with Streamlit for seamless user interaction and data exploration.

Implementation Strategy
1. Development Environment  
   - Python as the primary programming language.  
   - Virtual environment for dependency management.  

2. Data Processing:
   - Utilizes spaCy for NLP tasks.  
   - Implements data cleaning and validation to ensure data integrity.  

3. Visualization Development  
   - NetworkX for dynamic network graphs.  
   - Matplotlib and Seaborn for static and interactive visualizations.  

4. Interface Design  
   - Streamlit for a user-friendly, web-based dashboard.  

5. Agile Development  
   - Iterative testing and refinement based on stakeholder feedback.  
   - Unit and integration testing for reliability and performance.
